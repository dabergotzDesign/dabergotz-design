		<p>
			Hello,

			my name is Dennis Dabergotz, Game Developer with the focus on level design.
			Video games have a special meaning in my life and this exists until this very day.
			<br>  
			But what it means to develop a video game is something I learned at the
			School for Games.
			</br>
		
			Every Project I was involved with, I ended up to the position of a level designer.
			<br> 
			Now due to this experience and an ever growing love to level design, it is now something
			I really love to do and that’s where my passion goes in.</br>
			Since I am a 90’s kid and I grown up with Nintendo games, which my orientation for the design comes from and, like Nintendo, the goal is to bring a smile to the face of every<br> player who’s playing the games I was involved in.</br>
			
			Born, raised and still living in Berlin, Germany, which I think Berlin is a very good place when it comes to game development.<br>The dev community here is awesome, with a bunch of game studios, different events and game jams you’ll find a very good opportunity to meet with someone who has something to do as game developer. So, maybe we already met each other?</br> 
			
			<p></p>
			This should summed up my person and who I am, if not I’ll edit some things or better
			contact me if you want to know more about me.

			see you.
