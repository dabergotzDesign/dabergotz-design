            Hmmm, human music. We don't whitewash it either, Morty.
            I mean, the pirates are really rapey. Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood.
            Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no god, in your face! One dot muthafucka! Oh I say good sir, oh harumph, ohh a bope-a-dope-o-bobo.
            God? God's turning people into insect monsters Beth. I'm the one beating them to death. Thank me.
            Dont look at me! That guy over there roped me into this.
        </p>
        <p>
            They'll just fall right out of my ass! I've done this too many times! Hi! I'm Mr Meeseeks! Look at me! What are you looking at,
            mother fucker! 'Quantum carburetor'? Jesus, Morty. You can't just add a Sci-Fi word to a car word and hope it means something...
            Huh, looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery. We're gonna have to go inside.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm Scary Terry!! You can run but you can't hide, bitch! Holy crap, Morty, run! Run for your life, Morty,
            run! I-I've never seen that thing before in my life, Morty, I don't even know what the hell it is!
            We-we gotta get out of here, Morty, it's gonna kill us! We're gonna die,
            Morty! We're gonna die! Meeseeks were not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry!
            Do you know how many characters there are in the Simpsons Morty? There's like a-a billion characters, M-Morty.
            There was an episode where Former President BUSH was their neighbor!
