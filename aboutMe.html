            My name is Dennis Dabergotz, Game & Web Developer with focus on Level Design and Front-End.
            I like to Design stuff and build worlds, from tiny to big, that want you to deep dive into.            
        </p>
        <p>
            Video Games played a big part of my childhood. Nintendo had a big influence on me, with building game worlds, also
            they're teaching methods on game mechanics. Guiding the player through the level, see them how they interact with it and 
            having a good time with the game fills me with joy. Giving the players the same joy and playing experience I had, is
            something I want to give the players from the games I worked on.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Web Development happened by accident kind of. As it was hard for at the time to find a way to get into game Development
            on the job side. With already having knowledge about coding and development process.<br/> I could easily adapt and start on Web Development.
            What can I say about it besides it was fun, and still is, to create websites and experimenting with different design approaches.
            It felt similar to Level Design, guiding the user through the pages of your website. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am in more focus now on web development and will working on it for a while now. But the future for me will be Video Games.
