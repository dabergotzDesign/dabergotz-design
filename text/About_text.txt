INTRO

Hi everyone, my name is Dennis Dabergotz a Front End Web Developer with interest in design, games and technology.
Coming from a more hand crafting background, I turned my eyes on the digital way, which lead me to the <italic> School for Games </italic>
to become game developer.

Graduating as Game Developer got me into Web Development through suggestions, because a career as Game Developer is fragile.
I felled more and more in love with Web Development. Especially the Front-End and Design part. Hello UI/UX Design I said to myself and now after some online courses &
more self-study on the material, I want to go the way as UI/UX Designer.
