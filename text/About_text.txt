INTRO

Hi everyone, my name is Dennis Dabergotz a Web Developer with interest in design, games and technology.
Coming from a more hand crafting background, I turned my eyes on to the digital way when I started at the <italic> School for Games </italic>
as game developer.
Back then I wasn't sure about the coding part, though I was more focused on design and art. Everything changed on the project <italic> Frilled the Skilled </italic>.
A simple project that I had to manage together with a college who was also involved in it. 
With this project and some game projects afterwards, I've grown on coding  for game mechanics and getting more more save with manganing code and development.

After the graduation of <italic> School for Games </italic> the following months got to finishing up my final game project and try to get into Game Development in job.
The non-success on that part got me slowly into Web Development. With the help, or more precisely a kick in the butt, of a company where I got some help
to convert to Web Development. This process led me to two different educations on Web Development.
