INTRO

Hi everyone, my name is Dennis Dabergotz a Front End Web Developer with interest in design, games and technology.
Coming from a more hand crafting background, I turned my eyes on to the digital way when I started at the <italic> School for Games </italic>
as game developer.
Graduating then as Game Developer got me into Web Development through suggestions.
And this is where I ended up loving it and see a future in it. Especially being involved in the design process. Hello UI/UX Design.
