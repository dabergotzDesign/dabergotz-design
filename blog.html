              <!-- Concept -->
              <img src="img/blog-imgs/sylvain-sarrailh-highundergardenarstation.jpg" class="blogIMG" alt="concept art by Proletariat Inc.">
              <p>
                  I started with a concept art (see image above) where I was looking for an interesting light and room layout.
              </p>
              <p> 
                 Art comes from <a href="https://www.proletariat.com/" target="_blank">Proletariat Inc.</a> from they're game Streamline.
                Having in mind doing this scene in Unreal, a modern look & realistic look and had assets with interesting materials were the criteria
                that I had in mind for the background theme for my Website.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The scene from the concept art had everything in it, plus with spaces
                  where I could put my  own stuff in there.                  
                </p>

                <!-- Blockout -->
                <img src="img/blog-imgs/scene_blockout.png" class="blogIMG" alt="blockout scene">
                <p>
                  The Blockout phase was quickly done. Some of the models were a good challenge for me, but that's what I've needed to get
                  a better workaround with 3D Modeling, as I want to get better with it.
                </p>
               
                
                <!-- first Build -->
                <img src="img/blog-imgs/scene_firstAsset_build.png" class="blogIMG" alt="first build">
                <p>
                  The first asset complete build. Since Unreal was relatively new to me, creating these different materials and set them
                  up in the scene on the models and see how they interact with the lighting. Not gonna lie I had a blast when I made the
                  material for the stone wall. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The gallery and the room where the computer is, not seen on the image, were stuff I added to the scene
                  because I haven't figured out what I could use as a fitting background for the About Me and Contacts section for the
                  website. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The logo on the TV screen is from the old site style. The video played automatically when in play mode, only thing missing and
                  make it more believable was the light that would emit from the screen. Trying to animate the color of the light didn't work.
                  A different approach was to code the light colors. Luckily I found a good tutorial which helped me out. That was a first coding
                  in Unreal for a project, it's very different from what I am used to. Likely gonna use more coding in future projects. 
                </p>

                <!-- final -->
                <img src="img/blog-imgs/scene_finish.png" class="blogIMG" alt="final build">
                <p>
                  All must-have assets are in scene, lighting and post-processing had it's final touches. It's done...for now.<br/>
                  The scene itself is complete, but it will have some "live" into it. There are still some empty spaces, also notice
                  the empty shelves, these will be filled with models.
                  <p>
                      I'll see the models as kind of "easter eggs" as I choose to put
                      models in scene that reference to the portfolio pieces and high likely some of my favorite pieces from modeling. But that
                      is for the future.

                    R.I.P old website.

                <p>
                   Now that I am feeling more comfortable with the Unreal Engine, I think it was time to combine these newly learned skills
                   with Web design.

                   The background images were all rendered from a scene in Unreal. Having the page elements as an overlay or even be part with
                   the background itself was a challenge that I gave to myself. What better could be the presentation of a Level Designer and Front-End Developer. 
                </p>
                <p>After many platform changes with the old Website, starting as a Jimdo site, then make it in an actual self-made Website and now with the re-design.
                    For right now this should be the final design choice of my Portfolio Website.
                </p>
                <p>The new site will still have changes. The background images will be filled with more assets, hidden but visible, kind of like Easter Eggs within the scenes.
                  <br> Most assets will come from the games and websites shown here.
